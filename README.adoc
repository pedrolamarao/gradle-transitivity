= gradle transitivity exercise

We aim to build Gradle plugins providing custom configurations akin to "api" and "implementation".

This project defines plugin `custom` with sources in `buildSrc`.
This plugin defines dependency scopes `customApi` and `customImplementation`, and resolvable configurations `customCompile` and `customRuntime`.
Our goal is for `customCompile` and `customRuntime` to resolve like Java plugin's `compileClasspath` and `runtimeClasspath` respectively.
